This was my first functional Ruby on Rails web application.

Rock On, is a site for bands to share tracks from their latest albums and get feedback from other users on the site.

This rails app uses CanCanCan and Devise for user authentiaction and login flows. In addition I used the ActsAsComentable gem for the commenting functionality. I built custom comment flagging and administration of comments to improve the bands user experience.

One unique feature is that bands are able to customize the fonts and background images on their band and albums page. This allows them to show off their individuality to fans and users discovering their music for the first time.
